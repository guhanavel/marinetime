# Marinetime Digital Challenge
This project contains the code that helped our group win the Marinetime Digital Challenge competition. It is a route calculation system that allows users to choose a start and end location and calculates the optimal route between them. This solution aims to optimize maritime navigation by considering various factors such as distance, weather conditions, and vessel specifications.

# Features
Route calculation: Calculate the optimal route between a given start and end location.
Consideration of factors: Take into account factors such as distance, carbon dixoide useage to determine the best route.
